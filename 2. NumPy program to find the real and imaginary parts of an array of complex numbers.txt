Q2. (i) Write a NumPy program to find the real and imaginary parts of an array of complex numbers
Aim:

To find real and imaginary parts of complex numbers using NumPy.

Algorithm:

Import NumPy.

Create an array of complex numbers.

Use .real and .imag attributes to extract parts.

Program:
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([2+3j, 4+5j, 6+7j])
print("Array:", arr)
print("Real Part:", arr.real)
print("Imaginary Part:", arr.imag)

Output:
Array: [2.+3.j 4.+5.j 6.+7.j]
Real Part: [2. 4. 6.]
Imaginary Part: [3. 5. 7.]

Result:

Real and imaginary parts were separated successfully.

Q2. (ii) Write a NumPy program to convert a NumPy array into a CSV file
Aim:

To store NumPy array data into a CSV file.

Algorithm:

Import NumPy.

Create an array.

Use np.savetxt() to save it as a CSV file.

Program:
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
np.savetxt("output.csv", arr, delimiter=",", fmt="%d")

print("Array saved to CSV file successfully!")

Output:
Array saved to CSV file successfully!

Result:

NumPy array data was stored into a CSV file.
