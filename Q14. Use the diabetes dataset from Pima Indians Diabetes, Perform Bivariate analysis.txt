Q14. Use the diabetes dataset from Pima Indians Diabetes, Perform Bivariate analysis
Aim:

To perform Bivariate Analysis on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and visualize the relationship between two variables.

Algorithm:

Import the necessary libraries — Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

Load the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv).

Select two numerical columns for analysis (e.g., Glucose and BMI).

Use a scatter plot and correlation to analyze the relationship.

Display the visualization.

Program:
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("diabetes.csv")

# Display first few rows
print(df.head())

# Perform bivariate analysis using scatterplot
sns.scatterplot(x='Glucose', y='BMI', hue='Outcome', data=df)
plt.title("Bivariate Analysis - Glucose vs BMI")
plt.xlabel("Glucose Level")
plt.ylabel("BMI")
plt.show()

# Correlation between Glucose and BMI
corr = df['Glucose'].corr(df['BMI'])
print("Correlation between Glucose and BMI:", corr)

Output:
   Pregnancies  Glucose  BloodPressure  SkinThickness  Insulin   BMI  ...
0            6      148             72             35        0  33.6  ...
1            1       85             66             29        0  26.6  ...
...

Correlation between Glucose and BMI: 0.22


(Also displays a scatter plot showing the relationship between Glucose and BMI, color-coded by Outcome.)

Result:

The bivariate analysis revealed a positive correlation between Glucose and BMI, meaning that higher glucose levels are generally associated with higher BMI values. The scatter plot effectively visualized this relationship.
